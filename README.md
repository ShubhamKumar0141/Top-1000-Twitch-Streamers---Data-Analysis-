## 5.  Recommendations

- **Niche Consistency:** Focused content on fewer games is more likely to generate loyal followers and higher engagement.
  
- **Stream Duration:** Ideal stream duration appears to be **between 3 to 6 hours** for maximizing followers gained per stream without viewer fatigue.
  
- **Optimize Timing:** Stream during **high-growth days** like Friday and Wednesday to maximize discoverability.

- **Localized Growth:** Encourage multilingual streamers, especially in Spanish or Portuguese, as they show potential in engagement spikes in non-English regions.

- **Balance Personality with Skill:** Streamers should develop personal branding alongside gameplay, especially if in the esports category, to attract diversified followers.
